<h2>About Tic-tac-toe:</h2>
<p>
Also called Noughts and crosses (in the UK, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, India and the rest of the British Commonwealth countries), is a pencil-and-paper game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The X player usually goes first. The player who succeeds in placing three respective marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game. This explanation comes from Wikipedia and you can learn more about it by clicking <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe">here</a>.
